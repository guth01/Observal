"""Trusted proxy middleware (SEC-003).

Replaces Uvicorn's --proxy-headers flag with app-layer proxy handling
that uses the same trust config (security.trusted_proxy_ips) as the
rate limiter.

When the TCP peer is a trusted proxy this middleware:
  1. Resolves the real client IP from X-Forwarded-For (rightmost non-trusted)
     and overwrites request.scope["client"] so that ALL downstream consumers
     (audit, download tracker, rate limiter, etc.) see the correct IP.
  2. Reads X-Forwarded-Proto and sets request.scope["scheme"].

Unlike Uvicorn's --proxy-headers (which takes the leftmost XFF entry and
is trivially spoofable), this walks the header right-to-left and skips
trusted proxy IPs, using the same algorithm as _get_real_ip() in
api/ratelimit.py.

The setting supports both plain IPs and CIDR notation (e.g.
"172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8") so Docker-internal networks are matched
regardless of the container IP assigned at runtime.
